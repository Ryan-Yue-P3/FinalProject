About My Soccer Game Pro Supreme Ultimate: Coded entirely in Java, My Soccer Game Pro Supreme Ultimate is an interactive soccer video game  played with two users. Players are given a symmetric field, with one goal on each end of the field, where they score a soccer ball that is found on the field. At the start of the game, two players are on each side of the soccer ball. The players must run into the ball to move it or use the “kick” feature to kick the ball farther. The longer a player runs without stopping, the more speed they gain (this speed will be limited to avoid bugs). If a player  kicks the ball, the faster the player's speed, the further and faster the ball will travel. The ball will travel at twice the speed of the player if the ball is kicked. If the ball gets kicked into a goal, the player who scored will receive a point. The game will end when one player receives 5 points.


How to Play: Each player can move, Player 1 uses W, A, S, D and Player 2 uses the arrow keys  ↑ , ↓,  ←, →. Player 1 can also use the ‘Left-Shift’ key to kick the ball; Player 2 can use the '[space]' key to kick the ball. Running into the ball moves/blocks the ball as well. As you move, your speed slowly increases to mimic running.
