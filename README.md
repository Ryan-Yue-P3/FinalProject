My Soccer Game Pro Supreme Ultimate
By: Alex C, Humza D, Ryan Y

About My Soccer Game Pro Supreme Ultimate: Coded entirely in Java, My Soccer Game Pro Supreme Ultimate is an interactive soccer video game that is played with two users. Players are given a symmetric field, with one goal on each end of the field, where they are to score a soccer ball that is also given on the field. At the start of the game, two icons are spawned on each side of the soccer ball, each icon symbolizing a player. The players must run into the ball to send it somewhere, or use the “kick” feature to kick the ball farther. The longer a player runs without stopping, the more speed they gain (this speed will be capped to avoid bugs). If a player is to kick the ball, the higher the speed of that player when they kick it, the further the ball will go. If the ball is kicked within the goal, the player who kicked the goal will receive a point. The game will end when one player receives 5 points.

How to Play: Each player can move, Player 1 uses W, A, S, D and Player 2 uses the arrow keys  ↑ , ↓,  ←, →. Player 1 can also use the ‘Left-Shift’ key to kick the ball; Player 2 can use the “[space]” key to kick the ball. Running into the ball moves/blocks the ball as well. As you move, your speed slowly increases to mimic running.
